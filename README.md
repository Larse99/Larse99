Hi!
My name is Lars Eissink, 22 years old and living in the eastern part of the Netherlands.
Professionally I work in IT, but in my sparetime I like to deepdive and tinker around with all kinds of IT projects and subjects.

I have 2 big passions: Linux and Automatisation. So thats what you'll mainly find on my profile.

**Current stack**
* Proficient in Linux (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora)
* Ansible
* Bash
* KVM/QEMU
* Powershell (mainly for work)
* Front-end webdevelopment (HTML, (S)CSS, Javascript/jQuery)
* Back-end webdevelopment (PHP, MySQL)

Make sure to check out my Bash Scripts, Ansible Playboos and all other kind of stuff!
